       <h2>Our Journey</h2>
       <p>
           We started acting in Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia at 2001 as one ice cream shop and since then,
           we conquered our clients with passion and inovation, always bringing new 
           flavours and options for make the experience became still better!
       </p>
       <p>
           After years of work, we received one offer to sell ice creams for one 
           market in La Paz, and as we won't had one system of drivers, we need to contract private
           services and that happened till 2013 when we bought one truck and one brother of my friend
           sent for us.
       </p>
       <p>
        was not perfect but was one victory, after these years solding and sending ice cream,
        we are starting our mission of explore the internet and make Sierra Cremosa
        became one E-Commerce.
