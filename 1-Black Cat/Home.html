               <h2>About the Black Cat</h2>
<p> 
    A black cat, or black cat, is a domestic cat with melanism, which gives it the dark coloring of its coat.
     Due to myths propagated in the medieval era, the belief that black cats were witches turned into animals
    was spread. Therefore, in part of the western world there is a myth that says that crossing a black cat
    is a sign of bad omen. However, in several other cultures black cats are revered, being associated with
    the presence of good luck.International institutions for the protection of animals have established that
    on October 27th, the day of the black cat is celebrated, a date created with the aim of publicizing their
    qualities and encouraging the adoption of these felines, since these animals are usually less adopted than 
    the specimens. of other colors.
